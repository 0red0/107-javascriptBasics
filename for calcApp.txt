Alternative method other than eval():


Yes there is also ‘‘new Function(‘eval code here’)();” which does the same thing as eval.

Also to answer your other question, you wouldn’t need eval to calculate a math string. It can be done more safely like this:

var input = “2 + 3 * 4”;

var lastOpp = “+”;

return input.split(“ “).reduce((a, o) => {

if (String(parseInt(o)) === o) {

if (lastOpp === “+”) {
return a + parseInt(o);

}
if (lastOpp === “*”) {

return a * parseInt(o);

}

//etc

}

}, 0);

adding parenthesis and order of operations would require more.
