some javascript syntax i learned form odin's foundation:
 
<script>console.log("HelloWorld!");</script>

alert-let-var-const-return-class-function = variable declarations of js/functions.

the variable is a box what's inside is the value.
you can change the value as mush as u want.

//rule: declare a variable only once 
  let user;
  let x=5; 
  x = 7;   because fuck me. right js!
  const $;
  var _;
  let " ";   white space
	
to make a number decimal friendly:
use .tofix()
example: variable = variable.tofix(numbersAfter.inIt);

convert string to numbers :-  Number();
let x='5'; is a string type variable.

unary + is an operator that works linke Number()
example: let x =1;
		 +x ; // 1;
example:let apples=2;oranges=3; 
		alert( +apples + +oranges ); // 5
